Description of the data used in Stoffel et al. 

(1) seal_genotypes_basic_30.xlsx

Microsatellite genotypes for all 30 species used in the study, one species per tab.

(2) 30_species_10ktrees_final.tre

Phylogenetic tree of all 30 species in Newick format. Data was downloaded from
https://10ktrees.nunn-lab.org/ and the three ringed seal subspecies were added 
according to their divergence after the last glacial maximum.

(3) all_stats_30_modeling.csv

File with all data used for phylogenetic mixed modeling in the paper. Variables are
as follows:

Species names

tip_label: Name of the species corresponding to the .tre file
species: species name with underscores for programming
latin: latin names for plotting and paper
common: common names for plotting and paper


Ecological and life-history variables from Kr√ºger et al. (some were not used in the paper)

harem_size: Harem size
male_weight
female_weight
male_length
female_length
ICUN_rating: Updated based on IUCN status from June 2018
Abundance: Global Abundance
BreedingType: Ice or Land breeding or both.
birth_mass
breeding_season_length: in days
life_span_years:
latitude: of occurence
rel_birth_weight: relative birth weight 
log_male_weight
log_female_weight
Longevity
Generation_time
Age_primiparity


Statistics of the genetic data:

g2: identity disequilibrium 
CIlow: CI of g2
CIup: CI of g2
p_val: p value of g2

The following summary stastistics are rarefied and show the average across samples of
10 individuals each (see paper for an exact description)

For each statistic, there is one column for the mean, two columns for the confidence interval of the mean,
one column for the sd and two columns for the confidence interval of the sd.

The summary statistics are the following:

num_alleles_mean: Mean number of alleles per locus.
exp_het_mean: Expected heterozygosity
obs_het_mean: Observed heterozygosity
mean_allele_size_sd: Mean standard deviation of allele sizes across loci
mean_allele_size_kurtosis: Mean kurtosis of allele sizes across loci
mean_allele_range: Mean allelic range
mratio: Mratio (Garza and Williamson 2001)
prop_low_afs_mean: Proportion of low frequency alleles (<5%)

Starting with IAM_ratio, the results from the BOTTLENECK software are summarised:

IAM is the infinite allele model.
TPM is the Two-phase model.
SMM is the stepwise-mutation model.

The variables are as follows:

IAM_ratio: proportion of loci in heterozygosity-excess under the IAM
IAM_Wilc_Exc: p-value of test for het-excess under the IAM
TPM70_ratio: proportion of loci in heterozygosity-excess under the TPM 70
TPM70_Wilc_Exc: p-value of test for heterozygosity-excess under the TPM 70
...
same pattern until SMM_Wilc_Exc


Then some mixed variables follow:

nloc: number of loci for a species
nind: number of individuals of a species
bot: bottleneck model probability from the ABC analysis
neut: non-bottleneck model probability from the ABC analysis
common_abbr: Species abbreviation used in paper
SSD: Sexual size dimorphism (male / female weight)
abc_out: preferred model
logAbundance: log transformed abundance
logharem_size: log transformed harem size
logmale_weight
logbreed_season: log transformed breeding season length
loglactation_length: log transformed lactation length
logSSD: log transformed sexual size dimorphism.
