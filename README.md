# Analysis workflow for "Recent demographic histories and genetic diversity across pinnipeds are shaped by anthropogenic interactions and mediated by ecology and life-history"

## Overview

All scripts to reproduce analyses in the paper can be accessed via two repositories:

(1) Coalescent simulations and ABC analysis
- repository: https://github.com/mastoffel/Pinniped_bottleneck_CoalSimABC
- This part of the project is an extra-repository, the scripts of which should be run on a server with sufficient computing power

(2) All other analyses
- repository: https://github.com/mastoffel/pinniped_bottlenecks

In addition, we packaged some specific functions into the sealABC package, also accessible
on GitHub: https://github.com/mastoffel/sealABC
