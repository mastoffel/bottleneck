This PERL script converts the output of the 'ms-program' into microsatellite data. Information about the 'ms-program' can be found at: http://home.uchicago.edu/~rhudson1/source/mksamples.htmlTo run the program on an OSX Macintosh follow the steps listed below.note: for other OS similar procedures apply.1. move the output 'ms' output files into a new folder2. open the program 'Terminal'3. use command 'cd' to specify the location of the ms2ms.pl script on your computernote: you could also drag your folder on the active 'Terminal' window rather than typing the path4. type "perl ms2ms.pl" and press enter5. the ms2ms.pl script will ask now for the folder in which you placed the 'ms' output files and you have to provide the full pathnote: if you placed the folder containing the 'ms' output files in the same folder as the ms2ms.pl script, only the name of this folder (containing the 'ms' output files) is required6. ms2ms.pl will write the output files into the same folder as the input files. Output files could be used directly as input files for the MSA software and are named as: "out_inputfile".note: if multiple input files are contained in the folder ms2ms.pl will process them in a batch modems2ms.pl is also compatible with the previous version of the ms-program.A description of the conversion algorithm is described in: S.
